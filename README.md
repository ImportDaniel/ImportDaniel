Hi, my name is Daniel and I am a biologist specializing in bioinformatics.

In my research, I apply computational and bioinformatics tools to analyze large datasets of biological data.
I'm particularly interested in applying these tools to identify mutations associated with resistance against antiviral drugs, alongside tracking viral spread and potential changes in virulence or transmissibility.

I am proficient in Python and R, and I have experience with a variety of bioinformatics software packages. 
I am also interested in developing new computational methods for analyzing viral data.
